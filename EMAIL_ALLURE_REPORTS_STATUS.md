I've successfully updated your GitHub Actions workflow to generate and email Allure HTML reports. Here's what has been implemented:

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

#### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Updates** (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)
- ✅ **Allure CLI Installation**: Added automatic installation of Allure CLI in CI/CD
- ✅ **Allure Report Generation**: Added step to generate HTML reports from test results

- ✅ **Updated Email Attachments**: Now sends Allure reports instead of old pytest-html files

#### 2. **Docker Integration**
- ✅ **Dockerfile Updated**: Added Allure CLI and Java runtime to Docker container
- ✅ **Docker Report Generation**: Docker tests now also generate Allure reports
- ✅ **Docker Report Compression**: Creates separate archive for Docker test results

#### 3. **Email Configuration**
